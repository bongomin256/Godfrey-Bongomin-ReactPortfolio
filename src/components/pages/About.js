        I have 8 years of experience working in production, logistics, customer
        service, and management in a multi-cultural setting. Having already
        earned a BBA from a globally accredited university, I am currently
        attending a full-stack development coding bootcamp at University of
        Washington with a goal of becoming a full-stack web developer. I have
        experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript and MySQL.
